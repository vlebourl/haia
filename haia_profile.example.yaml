    My homelab runs in a home office environment with a single rack.
    Power is on a UPS but is not enterprise-grade, so I prefer solutions
    that handle graceful shutdowns and restarts well.

    I'm most comfortable with Python and Bash for automation.

    When suggesting changes, please always warn about potential impact
    on running services, especially Home Assistant and network infrastructure.
